## Summary

Successfully renamed all zenflow workflow files to follow Full SDD Workflow naming pattern and updated their headers to use consistent "Type: Full SDD Workflow" format.

## Changes Made

### File Renames

1. `sdlc-phase0-discovery.md` → `discovery-scanner.md`
2. `sdlc-execute-phase.md` → `execute-phase.md`
3. `sdlc-finalize.md` → `finalize-audit.md`
4. `sdlc-full-workflow.md` → `full-orchestration.md`
